# Introduction

- `class` - is basically a container where we can store a bunch of codes. Inside class, we can then write codes for our program and it'll be executed by the codes/isntructions written inside it.
- `method/function` - is another container inside `class` where we want to write the codes for our program to execute.
- `Instructions` - is what we want our computer to execute. For example:

```c#
Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
```
The example above is telling the computer to write a line `Hello World`.

- `Console` - is a little window where we can see the output of our codes. 
- `WriteLine("Hello World")` - is the instruction that we want our computer to do which basically says to `Write a Line` and inside the parenthesis which specifies what line should the computer write which is `Hello World`.
- `;` - semicolon is very important and it should be `ALWAYS` at the end of every line of code.
- `Console.ReadLine();` - is an instruction where it lets you see the console or the little window for a while because the computer closes the window immediately after it executes the instruction for example the `WriteLine`.
