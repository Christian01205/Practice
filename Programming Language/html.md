# Learning HTML Full Course
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

# Basic Elements

- `<html></html>` -> (You can also add `<html lang="en">` attribute, to specify what language do you want to use.)
- `<body></body>`
   - `<h1></h1>` -> which stands for heading (only used once and it's used to say what your website's topic is about.)
   - `<p></p>` -> stands for paragraph.
- `<head></head>`
  - `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
  - `<title></title>` -> Webpage title.
- `<!DOCtype html>` -> A doctype declaration that you should have in EVERY html file at the beginning.

# Head Elements

- `<meta name="author" content="name-of-the-author">` -> This is used to identify the author of the website.
- `<meta name="description" content="description-of-the-website">` -> This is used to describe your website with details as to let them know what it's all about.
- `<link rel="icon" href="png-file" type="image/x-icon">` -> This is used to add a little fav icon on your website tab.

## *Take note:*

- One missing thing in a code line can result into a whole list of `errors` when validating it. So After validating the file and it shows an error, visual code tells you that by making a certain `prompt` to turn into either color red/pink so make sure to follow it and DON'T FORGET TO ALWAYS VALIDATE YOUR WEBPAGE.
