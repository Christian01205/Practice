# Learning Git
- Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

# Basic Terms

1. Directory -> `Folder`
2. Terminal or Command Line -> `Interface for Text Commands`
3. CLI -> `Command Line Interface`
4. cd -> `Change Directory`
5. Code Editor -> `Word Processor for Writing Code`
6. Repository -> `Project, or the folder/place where  your project is kept`
7. Github -> `A website to host your repositories online`

# Git Commands

- Clone -> `Bring a repository that is hosted somewhere like Github into a folder on your local machine (i.e. VsCode)`
- add -> `Track your files and changes in Git`
- commit -> `Save your files in Git`
- push -> `Upload Git commits to a repo, like Github`
- pull -> `Download changes from remote repo to your local machine, the opposite of push`
